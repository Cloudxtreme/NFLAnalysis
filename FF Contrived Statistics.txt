-Injury rate for position by team

-Target % / Snap % : measure of target-use, decreases when snap% increases without corresponding target % increase, increases when target% increases without corresponding snap% increase
                     This is good to see if players are being used primarily as blockers or are running low percentage routes

-Yards/team snaps : measure of vertical usage (consistent big play potential). Lots of snaps without lots of yards (higher YPS) indicates either low YPT or low usage.  
                    [(yards/target)*(targets/ team snaps)]

-YPC - Offensive line yards per carry (RB) : measure of running back talent

-Age vs yards per snap (threshold number of snaps) by position : best age for position talent

-Red zone target or carry % by player : measure of red zone use

-player RZTD per RZtarget : player RZ effectiveness 

-player RZTD / team RZ snap : (player RZTD / RZtarget) * RZtarget/RZsnaps = player effectiveness * how often they go to player = RZ dependability by player for team
