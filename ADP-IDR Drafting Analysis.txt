I've been thinking of looking over the past few years to see how ADP and intrapositional rank (i.e. the ranking of that player by points scored within their playing position, hereafter "IPR") affect expected points for players, and how that plays into drafting strategy.
The (not-yet-wholly-thought-out) methodology would probably look something like this:

Organise players into their positions for the years 2012, 2013, 2014 (separately), and sort by total fantasy points.
Combine the three years together, weighted by recency (e.g. 2014 could be weighted as 80%, 2013 as 15%, 2012 as 5%)
Repeat steps 1-2, instead sorting by ADP.
Create two scatter plots for each position -- one for % of highest point total vs ADP, and the other for % of highest point total vs IPR.
Try to answer the following questions:

What is the relationship (if any exists) between IPR and ADP by position?

How strongly does IPR correlate with % of highest point total for the position? Is the strength of this correlation dependent on IPR (i.e. As IPR decreases, does the correlation decrease)?

How strongly does ADP correlate with points scored? Is the strength of this correlation dependent on ADP?

Between two IPRs, what is the expected points dropoff? (e.g. If I the 5th RB instead of the 6th RB, what is the expected points difference?)

Between two ADPs for a position, what is the expected points dropoff? (e.g. If I select a TE as the 10th draft pick instead of the 20th, what is the expected points difference?)

What is the expected value of a selection expected to be by IPR and ADP together (where ADP and IPR would be weighted by their correlation coefficients for that position)?

Assuming that every FF manager attempts to maximise the amount of expected points on their active roster (and then their bench), what is the expected strategy for each manager (by drafting position), considering league size?
