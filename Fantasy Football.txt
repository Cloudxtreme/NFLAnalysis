Create a points (% of high points for position) vs ranking curve for each position to see relative dropoffs
Create a points vs ADP curve for each position to see drafting dropoff

What is the relationship between rank # and ADP by position? (weight % dropoff by correlation coefficient for ADP and rank#)
How strongly does positional rank correlate with points scored? Is the strength of this correlation dependent on positional rank?
How strongly does ADP correlate with points scored? Is the strength of this correlation dependent on ADP?
How much dropoff is there between picks for a position?
What is the absolute value of a positional pick expected to be?
What has been historically the best strategy for drafting in order to maximise points (based on number of players and draft position)?

"Drafting a TE at the xth pick compared to the yth pick is expected to increase points yield by z for TE."
"TE was worth an average value of 60% of total value in the xth round."
"TE was worth an average value of 50% of total value as the xth TE picked."
"A TE drafted in the xth round is expected to be worth x points."
